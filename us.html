                <p style="text-align: justify;"><br><span style="color: rgb(32, 33, 34);">Since earliest times humanity has endeavoured to develop the most appropriate systems of organization to meet the challenges of a particular era. Inevitably the systems of organization that developed were reflections of the wider values, tradition and general organization of society at that time, moulded by the necessity of withstanding threat and seeking to innovate whilst maximising benefits from existing resources. Human development has continually necessitated a corollary of human and organizational development designed to maximize effectiveness. This progression is indicative of a civilizing process that has continually asked humanity to reassess its relationship with itself and to increasingly value the welfare of both the individual and wider society as a whole.</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_organizations#cite_note-Pinker2011-1"><sup><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 204); background-color: initial;">[1]</span></sup></a><span style="color: rgb(32, 33, 34);">&nbsp;The symbiotic relationship between strategic leadership and organizational structure necessary to success can be traced back to the beginnings of western civilization. Indeed, the very term&nbsp;</span><em><span style="color: rgb(32, 33, 34);">strategic</span></em><span style="color: rgb(32, 33, 34);">&nbsp;owes its etymology to the ancient Greek words for 'army' or a 'large body' and a 'leader'. In ancient Greece the '</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Strategikos&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"><span style="color: rgb(221, 51, 51);">Strategikos</span></a><span style="color: rgb(32, 33, 34);">' was the leader of the army</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(53, 53, 53);">There is no hard and fast dividing line between moral and religious tales on the one hand and historical tales and adventure stories on the other. The moral and religious concerns of nineteenth-century children’s writers do not disappear overnight: they simply become less prominent. The telling of a gripping story, the presentation of historical events and the description of distant places and unfamiliar human activities become more important than a simple didactic message. The lure of adventure is of course present in German children’s books right from Campe’s&nbsp;</span><em><span style="color: rgb(53, 53, 53);">Robinson der Jüngere&nbsp;</span></em><span style="color: rgb(53, 53, 53);">and the exploits of Baron Münchhausen and is swiftly expanded with Wyss’s&nbsp;</span><em><span style="color: rgb(53, 53, 53);">Schweizerischer Robinson</span></em><span style="color: rgb(53, 53, 53);">. Campe also provided exciting historical and geographical material in his books about the discovery of Central and South America and about polar exploration. But it was not until the middle part of the nineteenth century that German authors focussed more strongly on the narrative rather than didactic potential of historical and geographical themes.</span><span style="color: rgb(187, 187, 187);">2</span><span style="color: rgb(53, 53, 53);">Both Christoph von Schmid and C. G. Barth situate some of their stories in periods of considerable historical interest, e.g. the aftermath of the French Revolution or the Siege of Belgrade, but they do not exploit the historical material: it is simply the background for a particular set of events. The writer who took this one stage further was Gustav Nieritz (1795-1876), a Protestant schoolmaster and prolific author of children’s books, who spent most of his life in Dresden and its immediate vicinity. Nieritz was the author of nearly 120 books, the first of which appeared in 1829. He was always on the look-out for story material, which he took from many sources – his wide general reading, anecdotes, sermons and newspaper reports, visits to taverns, plays and operas. He acknowledged a debt to Salzmann, but in his youth he was also a keen reader of stories about robbers, knights and ghosts, which were then very much in fashion. Nieritz’s Protestant background is readily apparent in the stories he wrote, but he did not write with a solely religious motive. Posterity has not been kind to him. He was a workmanlike writer who turned his hand to a multiplicity of themes, but was undemanding and undistinctive in style and literary form. But in his own day he was a popular and productive author and eventually received an order of merit from the King of Saxony. Two years after his death the city of Dresden erected a monument in his memory.</span><br><br></p>
